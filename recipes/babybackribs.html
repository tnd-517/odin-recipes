        <h3>These slow cooker ribs are the best — they turn out perfect every time!</h3>
        <p>They cook in a crockpot until tender, then are covered with barbeque sauce and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs</p>
        <p>Perfect for during the week as the slow cooker does most of the work!</p>

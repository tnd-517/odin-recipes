        <h3>Fettuccine is used for this chicken and broccoli Alfredo recipe but you can use your favorite pasta.</h3>
        <p>Alfredo is a creamy, dreamy pan sauce made from butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
        <p>You can use Alfredo for coating broccoli or, most famously, fettuccine</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 ounces fettuccine, uncooked</li>
                <li>2 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
                <li>¼ cup Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing</li>
                <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                <li>1 ⅔ cups milk</li>
                <li>4 ounces Philadelphia Cream Cheese, cubed</li>
                <li>¼ cup Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
             </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook pasta as directed on package, adding broccoli to the boiling water for the last 2 minutes of the pasta cooking time. Drain pasta mixture.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat dressing in large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center, stirring occasionally, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in milk, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, and basil. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook until sauce is well blended and heated through, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

            </ol>
